We have received all three ACM Badges: &lt;em>Artifacts Available&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Aftifacts Evaluated - Functional&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Results Reproduced&lt;/em>.
The camera-ready version is approved by our Shepherd Lixin Gao, and submitted to ACM.

&lt;p>&lt;em>Snowcap&lt;/em> was developed during my Master&amp;rsquo;s Thesis at the Networked Systems Group at ETH, supervised by Rüdiger Birkner and Laurent Vanbever.
After 5 months after starting the project, and 1 month before the end of the thesis, we managed to submit the project to SIGCOMM. The entire technical work, and the writing process were part of the thesis.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
